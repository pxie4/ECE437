PDCN-1569#1 Warning
LUT equation term check  
Used physical LUT pin 'A2' of cell dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/SWITCH_N_EXT_BSCAN.id_state[0]_i_1 (pin dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/SWITCH_N_EXT_BSCAN.id_state[0]_i_1/I0) is not included in the LUT equation: 'O6=(A6+~A6)*((A5))'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue. If the cell is inferred or IP created LUT, please regenerate the IP and/or resynthesize the design to attempt to correct the issue.
Related violations: <none>

RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 I2C_Test1/hostIF/core0/core0/r0 has an input control pin I2C_Test1/hostIF/core0/core0/r0/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: I2C_Test1/hostIF/core0/core0/l287f1d33aab074157010cd04cb03cd77_reg_n_0_[5]) which is driven by a register (I2C_Test1/hostIF/core0/core0/l287f1d33aab074157010cd04cb03cd77_reg[5]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis.
